# BotFarmManager
Keep track of the status of your 3D printers.

## Project Goals
- Provide an easy to use interface for maintaining the status of your 3D Printer bot farm
- Utilize standard barcode readers to update a bot farm database
- Send bot farm status to a server on change
- Pretty :sparkles: website that reads bot farm status and updates accordingly

## Languages
- The backend code will be primarily Python 2.7 (Hopefully this will eventually run on a Pi)
- The frontend code will be CSS and HTML, with maybe a sprinkle of JS if we want to get really fancy
